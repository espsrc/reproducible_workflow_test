# reproducible_workflow_test
This is a dummy workflow to test different workflow management systems. The worflow will perform the following sequential steps:
* wget a file
* run a python script (with dependencies out of Python's stdlib)
* run a CLI tool
* run a CASA script

Inside this repository each folder will implement a different approach, and all of them should get the same output
